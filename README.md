# AGENTIX
Agentix is a Python framework for building AI agents with a "progressive disclosure" architecture. Key features include:  Seven-Node Blueprint: Complete agent architecture with LLM, tool, control, memory, guardrail, fallback, and human input nodes Progressive Complexity Levels: From one-line agent creation to full graph programming LLM Integration: Support for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and 100+ models via OpenRouter Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Dynamic memory system that evolves over time Model Context Protocol (MCP): Tool ecosystem with filesystem, web search, database access CLI Tools: For agent scaffolding, testing, and deployment Safety Guardrails: Input/output validation and content filtering The framework aims to be the "FastAPI for AI Agents" - making it easy to start simple and scale to enterprise-level agent systems.
